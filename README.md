# ATM Project

A simple toy JQuery application to fetch top repos from Github's search API. You can enter a username to fetch that user's repos, or you can fetch the top repos on Github overall. 

This project was originally made while I was a student at Hack Reactor. In its original form, it was more fully featured, with a SQL database and corresponding server routes to insert or retrieve data. This database would save repo data pulled from the Github search API. I intend to deprecate that feature because I don't think it adds to the user experience. 

NOTE: There is no API key associated with this application. I don't intend it for that heavy usage.

Steps to use.
1.Clone/download repo.
2. Type 'npm install'
3. (Optional) type knex migrate:rollback (this will wipe)
4. (Optional)
3. Type 'nodemon'
